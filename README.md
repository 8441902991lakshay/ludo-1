# Ludo

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo_%28board_game%29):

> **Ludo** /ˈluːdəʊ, ˈljuː-/ (from Latin ludo, "I play") *is a board
game for two to four players, in which the players race their four
tokens from start to finish according to die rolls.* […]

The goal of [this project](https://github.com/sudiptachatterjee/ludo) is
to bring this board game into the digital world.

Many variants are popular in many countries under various names.
We are familiar with some of them and will attempt to allow users to
follow different variants' rules.  If you know a variant that we don't,
please do let us know!

Also, be sure to visit our
[wiki](https://github.com/sudiptachatterjee/ludo/wiki) here on
GitHub—that's where we keep the full documentation of the project, both
for users and for developers.
